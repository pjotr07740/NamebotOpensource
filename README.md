# Namebot
## The best name censoring for your server!

## Top guilds
discord.gg/ftm

## About
This bot censors all usernames containing profanity with a word list, I know that isn't the best thing to do and that is why I have implemented some commands to set usernames to default, set usernames to a specific one, and just set the username to "[NAME REDACTED]".

## Commands
.help to display all the commands (they are not all written down here) </br>
.setup
