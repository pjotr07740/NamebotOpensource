  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Namebot is a project that I started while quarantining when I started I knew only the bare surface of coding, currently I have coded a full sharded discord bot. As of right now, I am busy with coding V3 of Namebot it will have log channel customization and much more!</p>

<div>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this bot is really simple, it censors usernames containing profanity. Or you can change them manually using a command. The bot scans usernames when you run the .scan_all_members command, when a user joins a server or if a user updates their username.

  <h3>How did you start your bot?</h3>
  <p>I don't know I was just bored and was sitting behind my desk all day gaming or making homework that got really boring so I started coding I looked up Python coding and started came by the channel called 'Tech With Tim' I watched around 4 of his tutorials until I came by the discord bot tutorial (I do not reccomend this tutorial anymore because it is outdated) then I started brainstorming about a bot that I want to create and there Namebot was born, I designed a logo posted in a self-promo channel of discord.gg/ftm and then a moderator came to me and thought that my bot was very useful, he went to the head moderator and he initiated a poll in between the mods, it got approved! From there I kept coding V1 for about a month, then V2 came with new, better and rewritten cogs! And currently here I am coding V3 and fixing the last bugs in V2.
